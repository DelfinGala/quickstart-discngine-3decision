This Quick Start is for users who want to deploy 3decision in an AWS subscription. Discngine 3decision is a web-based solution that combines a fully annotated and searchable database with a collaborative user interface and state of-the-art structural analytical tool. It is designed to give molecular modelers, medicinal chemists, and structural biologists a common ground for structure-based drug discovery.

This Quick Start is an alternative to Discngine 3decision SaaS and designed for organizations that want to keep their data in their AWS scope.

3decision for AWS does not have the full flavor of the 3decision vanilla SaaS version:
It comes with a few limitations, although they will disappear in the following weeks with the release of the next major version.

Current 3decision Quick Start limitations :

- Azure and Okta OpenID Connect authentication are not included yet. Only local accounts are supported.

- infrastructure monitoring is not included in this Quick Start.

- maintenance: 3decision updates are provided as helm charts updates. Although these upgrades are provided freely, the customer will need to apply helm upgrades himself to the EKS cluster.

- support: the Quick Start does not include a log collection mechanism. Support requests to Discngine might require the customer to provide logs.
