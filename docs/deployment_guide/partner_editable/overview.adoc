It comes with a few link:#_product_description[Restrictions and Limitations], although they will disappear in the following weeks with the release of the next major version.

Other limitations exist and concern support, monitoring and maintenance:

- infrastructure monitoring is not included in this Quick Start.

- maintenance: 3decision updates are provided as helm charts updates. Although these upgrades are provided freely, the customer will need to apply helm upgrades himself to the EKS cluster.

- support: the Quick Start does not include a log collection mechanism. Support requests to Discngine might require the customer to provide logs.
