== Predeployment steps

[start=1]
During deployment, you will be asked to provide a public/private SSH key pair. This key must be provided in base64 with line wrapping disabled (`` -w 0``).

....
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com" -q -N "" -f ./id_rsa_3decision
....

Encode both keys in base64 with the following commands:

....
base64 -w 0 id_rsa_3decision

base64 -w 0 id_rsa_3decision.pub
....

Copy the base64 string of both keys as you will need it during the cloudformation stack deployment.
