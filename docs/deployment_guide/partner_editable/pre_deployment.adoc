//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a Partner account. If there are none leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps

=== Authentication

During deployment, you will be asked to provide information about your authentication provider.

3decision supports both Azure and Okta.
You will need to give information about the tenancy or account and app client and secret.

Thus, you will first need to create an app in either of these as you will need to insert that information when creating the stack.

=== VPC Tagging

If you are deploying 3decision in an existing VPC, ensure that the private subnets have the correct tags. For more information, refer to https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-amazon-eks/#_launch_the_quick_start[Amazon EKS on the AWS Cloud].
