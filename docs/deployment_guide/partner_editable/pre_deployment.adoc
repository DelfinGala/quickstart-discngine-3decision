== Predeployment steps

During deployment, you will be asked to provide a public/private SSH key pair. This key must be provided in base64 with line wrapping disabled (`` -w 0``).

....
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com" -q -N "" -f ./id_rsa_3decision
....

Encode both keys in base64 with the following commands:

....
base64 -w 0 id_rsa_3decision

base64 -w 0 id_rsa_3decision.pub
....

Copy the base64 string of the keys. You need it during the stack deployment.

If you are deploying 3decision in an existing VPC, ensure that the private subnets have the correct tags. For more information, refer to https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-amazon-eks/#_launch_the_quick_start[Amazon EKS on the AWS Cloud].
