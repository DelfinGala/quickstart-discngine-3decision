//Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps leave this file empty.

== Post-deployment steps

=== [Optional] Add your SSL certificate to the application load balancer

If you did not provide an SSL certificate during the QuickStart installation, you can edit the load balancer listener in order to configure an SSL certificate:

[start=1]
. HTTPS setup

As shown in  <<postinstall1>>, edit the Application Load Balancer and switch the listener protocol from http to https.

[#postinstall1]
.Application Load Balancer HTTP to HTTPS switch

[start=2]
. SSL certificate setup

As shown in  <<postinstall2>>, change the default SSL certificate by either importing yours or selecting a certificate from IAM or ACM.

=== [Optional] Create CNAME record in your DNS provider

If you did not provide the Route 53 Hosted Zone Id during the QuickStart installation, you will need to create 2 DNS records into your DNS provider.

Both need to target the 3decision application load balancer. The address of this load balancer is the "DNS Name" as shown in <<postinstall3>>.


The 2 hosts you must define are:

[start=1]
. 3decision.<your domain> ( 3decision user UI )

[start=2]
. 3decision-etl.<your domain> ( 3decision admin UI )
